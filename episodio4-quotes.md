***Quotes***

Mamerto Menapace

>  Mi percepción a medida que envejezco es que no hay años malos. Hay años de fuertes aprendizajes y otros que son como un recreo, pero malos no son. Creo firmemente que la forma en que se debería evaluar un año tendría más que ver con cuánto fuimos capaces de amar, de perdonar, de reír, de aprender cosas nuevas, de haber desafiado nuestros egos y nuestros apegos. Por eso, no debiéramos tenerle miedo al sufrimiento ni al tan temido fracaso, porque ambos son sólo instancias de aprendizaje. Nos cuesta mucho entender que la vida y el cómo vivirla depende de nosotros, el cómo enganchamos con las cosas que no queremos, depende sólo del cultivo de la voluntad.
>  Si no me gusta la vida que tengo, deberé desarrollar las estrategias para cambiarla, pero está en mi voluntad el poder hacerlo. Ser feliz es una decisión, no nos olvidemos de eso.
>  A esta vida vinimos a tres cosas: A aprender a amar, a dejar huella y a ser felices.
>  Tratemos de crecer en lo espiritual, cualquiera sea la visión de ello. La trascendencia y el darle sentido a lo que hacemos tiene que ver con la inteligencia espiritual. Tratemos de dosificar la tecnología y demos paso a la conversación, a los juegos “antiguos”, a los encuentros familiares, a los encuentros con amigos. Valoremos la intimidad, el calor y el amor dentro de nuestras familias.
>  Si logramos trabajar en estos puntos habremos decretado ser felices, lo cual no nos exime de los problemas, pero nos hace entender que la única diferencia entre alguien feliz o no, no tiene que ver con los problemas que tengamos sino con la ACTITUD con la cual enfrentemos lo que nos toca.
>  Dicen que las alegrías, cuando se comparten, se agrandan. Y que en cambio, con las penas pasa al revés. Se achican. Tal vez lo que sucede, es que al compartir, lo que se dilata es el corazón. Y un corazón dilatado esta mejor capacitado para gozar de las alegrías y mejor defendido para que las penas no nos lastimen por dentro.
>  En este comienzo de año les deseo la bendición de Dios.


[Design Systems](www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook)

>  Understanding not only the what, but the why, behind the design of a system is critical to creating an exceptional user experience. Defining and adhering to standards is how we create that understanding. Doing so removes the subjectivity and ambiguity that often creates friction and confusion within product teams.

From Fernando Suarez

>  Sean Felices, disfruten del ahora.
>  
>  No critiquen a los demás ni a ustedes mismos
>  
>  No intenten cambiar a los otros, vean lo que tienen de bueno
>
>  Talentos, fortalezcan lo que Dios les dió (ejemplo de Federer)

From Eren Bali - founder of Udemy

> To really improve your life you need to things: 
>  
>  you need the tenacity of keep trying
>  
>  and take failures and put you to work on it
>
>  and you also need access (that's where internet takes place)


From aikido martial artist Morihei Ueshiba [courage and creativity](https://medium.com/personal-growth/how-to-build-your-courage-and-creativity-with-the-aikido-philosophy-d41b451b0e43)

>  Life is growth. If we stop growing, technically and spiritually, we are as good as dead. The Art of Peace is a celebration of the bonding of heaven, earth, and humankind. It is all that is true, good and beautiful.
>  
>  Always keep your mind as bright and clear as the vast sky, the highest peak, and the deepest ocean, empty of all limiting thoughts.
>  
>  When your eyes engage those of another person, greet him or her with a smile and they will smile back. This is one of the essential techniques of the Art of Peace.
>  Progress comes to those who train and train; Reliance on secret techniques will get you nowhere.


From learning linux to [problem solving skills](https://ryanstutorials.net/problem-solving-skills/)

Logic and Creativity Games

gamepadTwo more important skills to develop for problem solving are logical and creative thinking. Creative thinking allows us to discover new approaches which may be beneficial to us. Logical thinking then helps us to proceed down that path. Some people are naturally good at logical and creative thinking but if you are not then don't worry. Everyone can improve both of these and it's not too difficult.

One of the best ways to improve these skills is through practice. The more problems you tackle and persevere with to find solutions, the better you will become. The more you learn the more resources you will also have at your disposal to use in different ways so working through the tutorials you'll find on this site is good for you too.

Another great way to enhance these skills is through games. Games are fun and you learn best when you're having fun. Below you will find some good games to play. There are many more out there though so these are just to get you started.

Mastermind - Good for developing logical thinking.
Set - Develop your powers of observation.
Creativity Games - many fun and quick word games.
2048 - can you plan far enough ahead?
Petals around the rose - another good observation puzzle.
Ultimate Tic Tac Toe - again, good for planning ahead.
Sudoku
Chess
Rubiks Cube
Keep it varied. The more different games you play the better.
