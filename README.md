here updating from cellphone!.



This is my first gitbook \(hopefully the first of many... :\)

Need to check how to add gitbook already created into github repo...

I found out!

Integrating with GitHub is done in 3 steps:

1 - [Setting up our GitHub Integration]

[Setting up our GitHub Integration]: <https://help.gitbook.com/github/can-i-host-on-github.html#github-integration>

2 - [Granting access] to your repositories

3 - Linking a book to a GitHub repository]

[Linking an existing book]

You need to go to your gitbook account ( www (dot) gitbook (dot) com/book/[your-user]/[your-book-name]/settings/github )
then sync with a repo (or just create one first if you didn't) and sometimes you can force sync based on the content from your gitbook or from your github repo...

That's it!
