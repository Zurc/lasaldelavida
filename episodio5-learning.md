OOCSS (object oriented CSS paradigm)

[code.tutsplus](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/object-oriented-css-what-how-and-why--net-6986)

>  "Separating the structure from the skin means that your layout styling and your design styling are separate. One very practical way to do this is to use a grid system;"
>  
>  "Separating the container from the content means that any object (the container) should be able to adapt itself to accept any content;"

[smashing magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/)

>  "...the common styles are combined into a reusable “skin” and nothing is unnecessarily repeated."
>  
>  "we ensure that our styles are not dependent on any containing element. This means they can then be reused anywhere in the document, regardless of structural context."

[OOSass - The sass way](http://thesassway.com/intermediate/using-object-oriented-css-with-sass)

>  Separate structure and skin: You should keep the structure and positioning in a base object and the visual features (like background or border) in extender clases. This way you'd never have to overwrite visual properties.
>  
>  Separate container and content: Never mimic the structure of your HTML in CSS. In other words, don't refer to tags or IDs in your stylesheets. Instead, try to create and apply classes that describe the use of the tag in question. And keep nested classes to a bare minimum.

Softskills up to episode 6 included...

[softskills podcast - developer compensation](https://softskills.audio/2016/04/04/episode-5-developer-compensation/)

usually devs are not so comfy talking about compensation, but the people you are dealing with are very used to it, so don't be afraid to ask (tell me more details about this compensation, or you have a 10% annual bonnus, so whats the percentage of people who actually received the full percentage?)

[softskills podcast - what to look for in a dev team](https://softskills.audio/2016/03/21/episode-3-what-to-look-for-in-a-dev-team/)

3 things: able to learn, passionate about what company does (their mission), on the cutting edge (changing the world in some way). How much of disfunction that company has?

Ask different people from different roles/areas (leads, peers/software engineers, executives/vp's): 

to peers > how do you know what to work on each day? do you write unit tests? approach to technology?

to managers> how does your team what to work on each day? do your team write unit tests?
